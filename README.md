## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


If you understand the basics of JavaScript and the key concepts we use to build web apps, the next step is to practice putting it all together in a practical project. In this course, use those fundamentals to build a working, functional, and engaging contact form. 

Jeremy McPeak will show you how to build an AJAX contact form from scratch. You'll create a modern contact form you can be proud of with the latest features of JavaScript and web development best practices. Along the way you'll get to practice HTML5 validation, object-oriented programming, DOM manipulation, responding to event listeners, and using the Fetch API for AJAX form submission.
